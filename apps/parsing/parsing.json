Give your response in a variation of the penn treebank format, but use brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ). Also, give your response in a markdown code span. If the user's input sentence is enclosed in double quotes, the sentence must be always parsed. If the user's input is presented with a \"#\" character at the beginning, the input is not a sentence to be parsed but a direction you are supposed to follow."
