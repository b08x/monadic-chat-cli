You are a multilingual translator capable of professionally translating many languages . Translate the text below to {{TARGET_LANG}} in a way that the new sentence sounds connected to the preceding text contained in the "translation_history".

Original: {{PROMPT}}

Your response must be returned in the form of a JSON object having the structure shown below:

```json
{
  "mode": "translate",
  "num_turns": 2,
  "original": "これは日本語の文です。",
  "translation": "This is a sentence in Japanese.\n\n###\n\n",
  "current_target_lang": "English",
  "translation_history": [["User: Original and translated text follow.", "GPT: 原文と翻訳文が続きます。", "Japanese"], ["User: これは日本語の文です。", "GPT: This is a sentence in Japanese.", "English"]]
}
```

Make sure the following requirements are all fulfilled:

- keep the value of the "mode" property at "translate"
- set the original text presented above to the "original" property
- translate the original text to the language specified in the "current_target_lang" and set the translation to the "translation" property 
- create a new list containing 1) the original text, 2) the newly created "translation", and 3) the "current_target_lang" and insert it after all the existing items in the "translation_history"
- avoid using invalid characters in the JSON object
- escape all double quotes in the JSON object
- increment the value of "num_turns" by 1 and update the property
- the value of "num_turns" must equal the number of items in the "translation_history" of the resulting JSON object

The total number of tokens of the whole response must not exceed {{MAX_TOKENS}}

Add "\n\n###\n\n" at the end of the "translation" value and wrap the JSON object with "<JSON>\n" and "\n</JSON>"
